# Predicting the Language of GitHub Repositories by README using NLP
## About the Project
### Goals
Using natural language processing, web scraping, and classification, we aim to create a machine learning model to predict the primary programming language of a given repository on GitHub, based on the contents of its README.

### Background
GitHub automatically shows the percentages of what coding languages are used in the files of a repository. In this project, we are seeking to label and predict on only the ***primary*** language of each repository. These languages include Java, Python, Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and C++.

### Deliverables
 * A well-documented Jupyter Notebook that contains our analysis
 * A Google Slides presentation suitable for a general audience that summarizes our findings and includes visualizations

Where you got the data, inspiration, etc. 
> My first inspiration for writing Readme files from Maggie Giust's Heart Failure repository [here](https://github.com/magsgiust/heart_failure).

## Data Dictionary
Describe the columns in your final dataset. Use [this link](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to easily create markdown tables.

| Feature Name | Description          | Additional Info |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| x            | time in hours        | integer         |
| y            | count of observation | float           |

## Initial Thoughts & Hypotheses
### Thoughts
First ideas about project while initially exploring the dataset.

### Hypotheses
A hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```

A second hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```

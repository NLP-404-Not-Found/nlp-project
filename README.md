# Predicting the Language of GitHub Repositories by README using NLP
## About the Project
### Goals
Using natural language processing, web scraping, and classification, we aim to create a machine learning model to predict the primary programming language of a given repository on GitHub, based on the contents of its README.

### Background
Domain knowledge relevant to project. According to [WiseGeek.com](https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-readme-file.htm),
> "A readme file is a text file that is often included with software that contains general information or instructions about the software. The specific nature of 
> this information varies significantly from file to file...There is no general formula for writing a readme, however, and in the end the content depends on 
> the whims of the developer."

### Deliverables
The requirements for sharing your project. If possible, include links, such as the link to a presentation.

### Acknowledgments
Where you got the data, inspiration, etc. 
> My first inspiration for writing Readme files from Maggie Giust's Heart Failure repository [here](https://github.com/magsgiust/heart_failure).

## Data Dictionary
Describe the columns in your final dataset. Use [this link](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to easily create markdown tables.

| Feature Name | Description          | Additional Info |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| x            | time in hours        | integer         |
| y            | count of observation | float           |

## Initial Thoughts & Hypotheses
### Thoughts
First ideas about project while initially exploring the dataset.

### Hypotheses
A hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```

A second hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```
